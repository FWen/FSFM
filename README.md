This code is a demo of the algorithms in 
"Wen, Zou, Liu, Efficient Global Outlier Removal for Large Scale Multiview Reconstruction, 2018"

This code is modified from that of Carl Olsson at http://www.maths.lth.se/matematiklth/personal/calle/,
"Olsson, Eriksson, Hartley, Outlier Removal using Duality, CVPR2010".
The "bundle.m" and "krot_slack.m" are direct copy from Carl Olsson's, which are used here for comparison.

This used dadaset is also provided by Olsson at  http://www.maths.lth.se/matematiklth/personal/calle/
which has been used in their paper "Olsson, Eriksson, Hartley, Outlier Removal using Duality, CVPR2010"
We copy it here just for ease of use and for academic use purpose to illustrate the comparison results of the algorithms in our paper.
